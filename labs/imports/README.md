## Some Applications of Floats

Pi is a beautiful, transcendental number which has far reaching applications to almost all areas of mathematics, physics, computer science, and philosophy. Engineers would argue it is roughly equal to 3. 

We can use approximations of pi in our programs for ease of computation, and the division 22/7 leads to a number which is within 0.04% of the true value.
